This repository hosts the code from the InfoQ article
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/merry-swiftmas-from-infoq">Merry Swiftmas</a>
which shows how to create a Christmas tree using Swift and SceneKit for iOS.

The corresponding article describes how the code is put together.

This project was created with Xcode 7.1 and Swift 2.1. Later versions of
either Xcode or Swift may require mnior code tweaks.
